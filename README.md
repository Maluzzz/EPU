The world is in constantly change therefore the key of this development is the improve of the collective consciousness. Tired of outdated mentality people, a group of "campuseros"​ have got decided work together to discuss what would be ideal to communicate, learn, and teach to make life better.

In editions of Campus Party Brasil the EPU group was formed among friends who share these ideals. Today, there are more than 400 enthusiasts, expanding it internationally. 

We help our unemployed members find new job opportunities and also their ideas can become business motivations to Startups. 

We bring together programmers, software developers, open source makers and software enthusiasts, Information Technology entrepreneurs, hackathon participants, engineers and geeks who love DIY projects, IoT and technological evolution. As a result, we have flexibility to merge ideas and split into multidisciplinary teams.
